Actually I don't know what I'm going to write here yet, but I'm hyped to start. 
A small step for the whole world, but a huge leap for a lazy me, right?

Anyway... where was I? So I'm going to play with the most basic and boring tags that HTML has: paragraps, headings, lists and images. I say they are boring, but I'm not qualified to do better stuff yet, so I shouldn't be a snob just now.

So, dear audience, have fun enjoing the basics.

Let's roll!
